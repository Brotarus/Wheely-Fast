For our term project, We are going to be creating a small racing game. Where
the user(s) can race a small car around a race track. We would like the
game to use graphics, but we have no previous experience with grpahics so
we are still unsure of exactly how we going to accomplish this goal in such
a short amount of time. We will try our best to get a functioning game by
the end of term.

This game will be a local game that will be one or two player depending
on what is selected at start up of the game. The cars will be able to go
around the track and race each other. My hope is to be able to keep track
of the number of laps each car completes around the track as well as
display their current speed. I would also like to add a little boost
option where each player gets a small amount of boost and can use it to 
gain a temporary speed boost to help them get around the circuit faster
than the other. I would also like to add a speed trial to the game where
one player races against the clock to beat the time the computer generated.
Finally I want to have mutlitple maps that the user(s) can select, or
choose random, maps to race on.

To play the game the user(s) must select which game mode they would like
to play on. For one player they must race a time trial around the circuit 
and beat the clock. For two player the users must race each other until
time and/or laps run out, whichever is first. For one player the user will
use the WASD keys and for two player they will use those plus the arrow keys
in order to control the two cars. As well as the 'E' key and left shift key 
for boost, for one and two player respectively.
