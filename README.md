For our term project, We are going to be creating a small racing game. Where
the user(s) can race a small car around a race track. We would like the
game to use graphics, but we have no previous experience with grpahics so
we are still unsure of exactly how we going to accomplish this goal in such
a short amount of time. We will try our best to get a functioning game by
the end of term.

The game that we came up with simulates driving a car on a straight road
where you have to avoid the randomly generated barriers that you are approaching.
If you hit a barrier the game ends and your score will pop up on the screen.
The controls are very simple, you can move left or right depending where you are
on the road.

START GAME:
- To start the game simply press enter on your keyboard and then begin using the 
left and right arrow keys to move the car.

END GAME;
- If you want to end the game early press the esc key.
- If you hit a barrier the game will end to exit hit the esc key.
